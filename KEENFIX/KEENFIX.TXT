 KEENFIX.COM - VGA mode 0xD retrace\color fix v0.3 by wbc\\b-state 15.o5.2o16

 DISCLAIMER:

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      YOU ARE USING IT AT OWN RISK!

 This TSR sets NON-STANDARD CRTC parameters, BUT I will not response for
 possible monitor\VGA adapter damage or malfunction, so...go ahead :)

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Yep, this is the latest version of KEENFIX, pretty large but with some PSP
 tricks and code optimization it takes only 128 bytes(!) in memory and it
 can work either in border or noborder modes, so try it NOW! :)

 - run "KEENFIX.COM" to install with border, run it with "/B-" key to disable
   top\bottom\right border in order to fix monitor adjustment issues.
 - you can release it by using "/U" or "/R" keys if no other TSRs which hooks
   INT10h are loaded after.
 - after loading, you can reset border\noborder state of TSR in any moment,
   just run KEENFIX with "/B+" (border) or "/B-" (noborder) key
 - you can omit the "/" symbol or replace it with dash ("-"), also keys are
   case-insensitive.
 - "/U" and "/R" keys can be written as "/UNLOAD" or "/RELEASE" or with any
   word starting with U or R, they will work just as short versions :)

 example:
 KEENFIX.COM     - run it with border enabled
 KEENFIX.COM /B- - reset to disable border
 KEENFIX.COM /B+ - reset to enable border
 KEENFIX.COM /UNLOAD_IT_RIGHT_NOW - no comments :)

 That's all :)
