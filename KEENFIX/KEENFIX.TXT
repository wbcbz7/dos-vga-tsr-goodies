 KEENFIX.COM - VGA mode 0xD retrace\color fix v0.4 - wbcbz7 - 2015-2022

 DISCLAIMER:

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      YOU ARE USING IT AT OWN RISK!

 This TSR sets NON-STANDARD CRTC parameters, BUT I will not response for
 possible monitor\VGA adapter damage or malfunction, so...go ahead :)

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Yep, this is the latest version of KEENFIX, pretty large but with some PSP
 tricks and code optimization it takes only 128 bytes(!) (note: 0.4 bumped it
 back to 160) in memory and it can work either in border or noborder modes

 - run "KEENFIX.COM" to install with border, run it with "/B-" key to disable
   top\bottom\right border in order to fix monitor adjustment issues.
 - you can release it by using "/U" or "/R" keys if no other TSRs which hooks
   INT10h are loaded after.
 - after loading, you can reset border\noborder state of TSR in any moment,
   just run KEENFIX with "/B+" (border) or "/B-" (noborder) key
 - you can omit the "/" symbol or replace it with dash ("-"), also keys are
   case-insensitive.
 - "/U" and "/R" keys can be written as "/UNLOAD" or "/RELEASE" or with any
   word starting with U or R, they will work just as short versions :)

 example:
 KEENFIX.COM     - run it with border enabled
 KEENFIX.COM /B- - reset to disable border
 KEENFIX.COM /B+ - reset to enable border
 KEENFIX.COM /UNLOAD_IT_RIGHT_NOW - no comments :)

 That's all :)

 changelog:
  v.0.4 - restore CRTC lock status - Catacomb 3D finally works now
          fix noborder register values, leaving 1px top ("thanks" nvidia)

  v.0.1 - 0.3 - can't remember now, check vogons threads :)
